## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox or other browser to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I found out that flexbox is the way and i will learn it. Also to the answer to how in the world do you center a div. The answer is: You dont.



Theres this really cool thing for nth classes called nth tester: https://css-tricks.com/examples/nth-child-tester/

### Continued development

Everything, i need to actually be good at html, because as of right now, im not doing as good as id wish i was doing.
